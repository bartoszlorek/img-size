# img-size
The small library that specifies the size of images inside parent element. It is a JavaScript implementation of CSS background-size for images. The image can cover all available space or constrained to fit with the longer edge.

## Initialization
```javascript
imgSize(options)  // parameter is optional
```
Options are classes generated by script, default:

```javascript
{
    container: 'img-size-container',
    horizontal: 'img-size-h',
    vertical: 'img-size-v',
    contain: 'img-size-contain',
    cover: 'img-size-cover'
}
```
## Types
All classes with the exception of the `type` classes are added or removed automatically.

### contain (default)
Scales the image as large as possible without cropping or stretching it. To use this method, add the `contain` class (or not, because it is default type) to the image.

### cover
Resize the background image to cover the entire parent element aka container, even if it has to cut one of the edges. To use this method, add the `cover` class to the image.

## Example
```javascript
import imgSize from 'img-size'

const size = imgSize()
const imgs = document.querySelectorAll('img')

size.attach(imgs)
```

## Methods
### attach
```javascript
.attach(image)
```
Add given node(s) of `HTMLImageElement` to the `img-size` instance.

### detach
```javascript
.detach(image)
```
Remove given node(s) of `HTMLImageElement` from the `img-size` instance.

### update
```javascript
.update()
```
Update sizes of all images attached to the `img-size` instance.

### destroy
```javascript
.destroy()
```
Remove added classes from all images attached to the `img-size` instance and destroy it.
